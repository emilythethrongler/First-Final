    <h2>Welcome to my blog!</h2>
    I am an individual from an tribe south of Utah, I was brought into Caesar's Legion as a child. Having survived training, I was made a legionary and fought well 
    enough to be promoted to the rank of Decanus. I became a Frumentarius following a brilliant tactical maneuver I call the "Throngle" when in a battle against a tribe. Since then,
    my tactics have been an unwarranted point of contention among the Legion, and while Caesar knows of my use of spying and deceit in war, not everyone agrees with the 
    methods employed by me. Especially that asshole, Lanius. I was responsible for the destruction of the Twisted Hairs at Dry Wells once the Legion's campaign ended in Arizona. 
    Those of the Twisted Hairs who resisted were crucified alongside Interstate 40. By 2281, I was the leader of the Frumentarii and the mastermind behind many of the Legion's 
    intrigues, such as outreaches into NCR-controlled territory including Racket, the Battle of Nelson, the euthanization of Nipton, as well as the destruction of Camp Searchlight, 
    This severely weakened the NCR's position in the area and allowed the Legion to cross the Colorado River and establish an outpost at Cottonwood Cove.
    These actions have made me infamous among the NCR Army, enough to be prominently featured in military propaganda.Along with orchestrating most (if not all) 
    sabotages west of the Colorado, I am very capable on my own and a master of disguise, having visited the Strip several times before giving the Courier the Mark of 
    Caesar. I am a devout believer in the teachings of the Caesar and firmly hold loyalty up as one the Legion's core tenets along with martial excellence and justice.
    I took to massacring Nipton to send a message that none are safe from Caesar's reach and prove the moral debauchery of those living under the NCR.
    I am is particularly disgusted by disloyalty and makes a point of punishing those caught in Nipton in a similar way that disloyalty is punished in the Legion.
     A special punishment was given to the mayor, Joseph Steyn, burning him alive on a tire fire for trying to deceive those he put under his care. I am also disgusted by 
     inaction and selfishness, making note of how, even though my men were outnumbered by those caught in Nipton, none tried to revolt during the lottery.
